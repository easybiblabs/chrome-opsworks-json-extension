This will be at some point a nicer editor for the "Custom JSON" in Opsworks.

The current version works, but is pretty much a proof of concept hack, and has a CSS bug which renders the editor about 20px "off". Usage in production environments is strongly discouraged. Use with caution and at your own risk.
