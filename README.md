This will be at some point a nicer editor for the "Custom JSON" in Opsworks.

The current version works, but is pretty much a proof of concept hack.
Usage in production environments is strongly discouraged. Use with caution and at your own risk.

This extension uses [Jsoneditor](http://www.jsoneditoronline.org/) by Jos de Jong, and [Jquery](http://jquery.com/).
